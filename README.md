# Pandas
This CPP program is an exploratory project which aims to understand how the Pandas module in python works with the perspective of C/C++ users.
This project is still an ongoing project and anyone is welcome to contribute towards the development of the project.

Implemented functions:
* head(number) = prints the first few data
* print(df) = prints the entire dataframe
* df.columns = identifies the columns of the data
* countRows = counts how many non empty rows does the data have.
